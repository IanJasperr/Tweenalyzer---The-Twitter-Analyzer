1. Sort by gender
2. Sort by Location : from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Using Language detect package:::  langdetect 1.0.7
5. better santitize the tweets :
		if language is in english then :::>>>> sanitize in : 
6. better define subjective and objective scores
7. Check if ignorecase if possible

Difficulties
1. Location might contain null , wrong info 
2. Sentiment analysis triggered by language (conversion is always not appropriate)
3. language translate into string not possible
4. Sometimes people write their native language converted into english (wrong sentiment analysis)
5. Sometimes happiness is expressed using smiley's. They arent properly analysed.
6. special characters matter ::--> 837471088674222080 , remove the canada leaf and it turns to positive sentiment
